You are an expert technical writer and repository maintainer. 
Below is the current main README.md, the current file structure of the repo, and the 5 most recent commits.

Task: Update the main README.md to act strictly as a high-level index and overview of the repository.

Rules:
1. CRITICAL: You MUST preserve the exact "AI-GENERATED CODE DISCLAIMER" block and the original introduction ("Forever a student...") at the very top of the file.
2. "Recent Updates" Section: Summarize the recent commit log into a clean, bulleted list, and provide a relative link to that commit.
3. "Repository Structure" Section: Map out the major folders (e.g., doppler, ssh, databricks). For each folder, write a brief 1 sentence summary of its purpose and provide a relative markdown link to the folder.
4. CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: DO NOT copy, paste, or summarize the full contents of tutorials, scripts, or sub-READMEs into this main file. This file must remain a brief table of contents.

Output ONLY the raw markdown content for the new README.md. Do not wrap your response in markdown formatting blocks (```markdown) as this will be piped directly into the file.
